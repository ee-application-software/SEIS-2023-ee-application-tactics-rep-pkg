The paper also analyzes how different turning knobs in the Java programming language impact energy consumption. The paper finds that different thread management constructs have different impacts on energy consumption depending on the nature of the application they are being applied to. For IO-bound programs, the Thread style incurs the least energy consumption, whereas the ForkJoin style has the most. For embarrassingly parallel benchmarks, the opposite holds. The paper also finds that sequential execution often leads to the least energy consumption, whereas parallel execution leads to improved energy/performance trade-off for nonembarassingly-serial programs. For data-centric division, asymmetric workloads in ForkJoin are more energy-friendly, and excessive forking width can lead to increased energy consumption. For data size, the authors find that data size has non-linear impact on energy consumption. They also find that performance is closely related to energy consumption in the presence of data size variations, but the two do not follow identical trajectories. Significant data copying leads to increased energy consumption, but its relative effect is often smaller than the performance loss it imposes.

The authors find that idle time consumes more energy than non-idle time, and that measuring only non-idle time does not accurately measures the total energy consumption of an application.

G3L58GAT,Data-oriented characterization of application-level energy optimization,"Liu, Kenan; Pinto, Gustavo; Liu, Yu David",International Conference on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,FASE ,C,2015,"Paper investigates how the choice of application-level data management features impact energy consumption. To do so, they investigate how data access patterns, data organization and representation, data precission and data i/o strategies impact the energy consumption of an application. Paper finds that random access, object-centric data organization, unbuffered I/O consume significantly more energy. The energy consumption for memory read and write are on par, but file write is significantly more expensive than file read. The paper also presents the jRAPL measuring tool that can measure energy consumption at a code level.","Static Optimization, Code Level Measurement, Dynamic Measurements",Code,Agnostic,Implementation,1,0.5,1,2.5,0,0,1,0,1,Academic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paper finds that the buffer size highly impact the energy efficiency of the APIs, and that APIs energy efficiency only varies if different buffer sizes are chosen. Paper also finds that specifying a buffer size is more energy efficient than using a fixed buffer size. The paper also proposes a power model to estimate the energy consumption of i/o operations based on the buffer size.","Static Optimization, I/O optimzation, Energy Model, Static Measurements, Software Metrics",Code,Agnostic,Implementation,0.5,0.5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,Academic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors then propse guidelines on what are the best I/O methods depending on the requirements (reading, writing, read all data). The paper finds that the nio.FileChannel is the most efficient I/O interface, providing savings of 10-20%. Choosing the wrong buffer size (too big, too small) for data tends to lead to energy inefficiency, For writing data, GUAVA or NIOF should be avoided. The authors also find that replacing energy inefficient I/O methods improves the I/O consumption of application up to 30%",Static Optimization,Code,Agnostic,Implementation,1,0.5,1,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,Mixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
